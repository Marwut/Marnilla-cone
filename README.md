### About me :)
  I'm an undergraduate computer engineering student currently interested in backend app development, UI Design, and software + hardware systems.
  My goal is to strengthen my skills in development and explore new technologies. Currently, I'm working on building small projects
  to build upon my current knowledge. I love building things that are creative and helpful for others!

- Besides programming, I'm a big fan of video games, movies, 
learning about history, drawing, and coffee (it's a mild addiction).
